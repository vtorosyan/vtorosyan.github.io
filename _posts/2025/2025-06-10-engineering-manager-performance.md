title: Performance of an engineering manager
---

In one of my previous posts, I talked about [performance quantification for IC engineers](https://vtorosyan.github.io/performance-reviews-quantification/), and recently I’ve been thinking about whether we can map the same framework (or way of thinking?) to quantify engineering managers' performance. Quantifying performance is always hard, and it is especially hard for engineering managers.

In [High Output Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Output_Management), the author’s primary point is that “a manager's performance is measured not by individual output, but by the output of their entire organization and those influenced by them.” 

While I think there’s truth in this, it should also be taken with a grain of salt. I’ve seen several cases where this sentence breaks down:

A team that delivers sustainably over a long period of time, but:
- Relies solely on a few individuals
- Is generally dysfunctional: some people are by default on "vacation mode", others work so hard that the team’s velocity is not only going down, but paradoxically “improving” (perhaps due to fewer people involved?)

A team that delivers, but:
- Is overworked and doesn’t feel safe giving upward feedback or being transparent
- Has a manager who is very dysfunctional (can be absent, brutal, autocratic, and so on)

This gets even more complicated in modern companies, where people change jobs frequently (the average tenure is around 18 months in the industry). 

In some companies, like GitLab, there’s even a longevity work requirement that states: “External candidates with 5 or more years of experience should have at least one job with 2+ years of tenure where they were not self-employed or a 'Founder' from the past 5 years.”. While this is not 100% related, I personally find it a good example of why it’s important for managers to stay with a team for more than a short period.

In some companies, you’ll also see annual or biannual culture surveys or management feedback cycles. Trusting the survey data is tough, as power dynamics always play a role and you typically get only 20% of the full picture.

So, all things considered - the question is: how do we quantify engineering managers' performance?

Let’s start with the requirements of the job (averaged out, obviously): hiring, retaining talent, performance management, delivery, and strategy.

## Rethinking input, output, outcome, and impact for managers

When you zoom out from the mechanics of all these (and many more) responsibilities, a clear pattern starts to emerge: in each of them, you can reason about input, output, outcome, and impact.

- **Input**: Your effort and time. This includes 1:1s, coaching, planning, hiring loops, running retros, resolving team conflict, and even emotional labor. Input is invisible unless you make it visible - but it's the foundation of everything else.

- **Output**: The tangible things you create. Strategy docs, performance plans, hiring decisions, onboarding plans, roadmaps, rituals, presentations - these are the artifacts of your management work.

- **Outcome**: The effectiveness of your work. Did your new hire succeed? Did your growth plans help engineers get promoted? Did your team rituals lead to better delivery or less burnout? Outcomes tell us whether your output made a difference.

- **Impact**: The lasting change you've created - often beyond your team. This might be new leaders you’ve grown, company-wide processes you’ve improved, or cultural shifts you’ve led. Impact is how your work compounds.

### Concrete examples

**Hiring**

- Input: The interview plan, hiring committee, feedback loops you put together
- Output: Interview results, candidate feedback, and so on
- Outcome: Hired or not hired
- Impact: A new team member joins, team velocity goes up, etc.

**Performance management**

- Input: Identifying low performers
- Output: PIP or any other plan to support them in getting back on track
- Outcome: Exit or succeed
- Impact: An engaged and motivated team member — or their exit results in improved team happiness

## A performance formula for managers

Just like with ICs, a manager’s performance can be viewed as a weighted combination of these four dimensions:

> Performance = w₁(Input) + w₂(Output) + w₃(Outcome) + w₄(Impact)

The weights change based on context. For example:
- A first-time manager might be measured more on Input and Output
- A senior EM or Director might be evaluated heavily on Outcome and Impact

This formula helps make expectations explicit and performance conversations less subjective.

## Tracking and improving

The most effective managers I’ve worked with track their own progress weekly:
- What did I do that had lasting value?
- Where did I spend time but get no results?
- Did I create leverage for others?

Keeping a weekly log, even a short one, helps avoid surprises during review season. It also helps identify patterns: Are you spending all your time unblocking, but not investing in long-term outcomes? Are you over-indexing on input and burning out?

# Final thoughts

Being a great manager isn’t about being the busiest, the loudest, or the most liked. It’s about being effective - creating the conditions where others can thrive, and where good decisions happen without you in the room.

By quantifying performance through Input, Output, Outcome, and Impact, we can build clarity, reduce bias, and have better conversations about what success actually looks like.

And perhaps most importantly: it reminds us to value the invisible work - because that’s where leadership lives.

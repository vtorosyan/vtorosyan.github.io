title: What makes you stand out for a promotion
---

Many people start thinking about promotions only when the cycle is approaching—polishing their self-review, gathering achievements, and putting together a compelling case. But by that point, it’s often too late.

The reality is that promotions aren’t won during the cycle. They are built over time. Before you even consider pushing for a promotion, there are critical things to get right. Otherwise, you risk assembling a package that doesn’t land, no matter how well you think you’ve performed.

Over the years, I’ve participated in many promotion cases—both as someone advocating for others and as someone building my own case. And what I’ve realized is that there are always certain factors in the air—things that people kind of know matter, but that rarely get talked about explicitly.

These unspoken expectations often make the difference between a strong promotion case and one that doesn’t quite land. So, I decided to write down a few of these implicit factors and make them explicit. If you’re thinking about a promotion, understanding these elements early can help you stand out and build a stronger case.

### 1. Have you done extra work beyond your core role?

Doing your job well is expected. Getting promoted requires showing that you can operate at the next level. That means taking on “extra work”—not in the sense of working more hours, but in solving bigger problems, improving systems, and driving change beyond your immediate responsibilities.

I like to think of this as the 80/20 rule: 80% of your time should go into executing your role with excellence, but 20% should be invested in initiatives that push boundaries.

### 2. Do you know how you work, not just what you deliver?

Many people focus on what they do—technical achievements, shipped projects, resolved issues. But promotions often hinge on how you work.
	• Do you collaborate effectively?
	• Do you help others grow through mentorship or support?
	• Are you organized, proactive, and able to navigate ambiguity?

The way you approach work—your leadership style, problem-solving ability, and influence—determines whether people see you as someone ready for the next level.

### 3. Who follows you, and why?

One of the strongest indicators of readiness for promotion is influence. Before pushing for a promotion, ask yourself: Who follows me, and why?
	• Do people naturally seek your input?
	• Are you the go-to person for certain decisions?
	• Do others trust you to lead or represent them?

Building a network of followers is crucial—not as a political move, but as a reflection of your real impact. If no one is looking to you for guidance or leadership, it might indicate that you’re not yet operating at the next level.

A great exercise is to have conversations with those who regularly rely on you and ask them what they value in your work. This not only gives you confidence but also sharpens your narrative when the time comes to build your promotion case.

### 4. Do you have traceable, observable evidence of impact?

One of the biggest mistakes people make is assuming their work speaks for itself. It doesn’t.

Promotion reviewers are often people who don’t work with you directly. If your impact isn’t easy to understand, it may not be recognized.

Your work needs to be:
	• Traceable – Can someone clearly see the progression of your contributions over time?
	• Observable – Is there tangible evidence of what you’ve built, influenced, or improved?
	•Easy to parse – Can someone who doesn’t know you quickly grasp why your work matters?

This is why **outputs still matter**—despite the common advice to focus on impact and outcomes. While impact is the goal, people reviewing promotion cases often look for concrete evidence. If your work isn’t well-documented or lacks clear proof points, it becomes harder to advocate for your promotion.

### 5. Have you already been operating at the next level?

Promotions aren’t about potential, they’re about demonstrated ability. By the time you ask for a promotion, you should already be performing at the level you’re aiming for.

If you need to convince yourself (or others) that you’re ready, you probably aren’t there yet. Instead of chasing a title, focus on expanding your scope, refining your influence, and making your impact undeniable.

### Final thoughts

A promotion isn’t something you “go for.” It’s something that naturally happens when you’ve built enough proof that you’re already operating at the next level.

If you’re thinking about a promotion, don’t just focus on assembling a package. Focus on making yourself undeniable—through extra work, strong collaboration, influence, clear evidence, and consistently operating at the next level. By the time the cycle arrives, your promotion case should already be obvious.

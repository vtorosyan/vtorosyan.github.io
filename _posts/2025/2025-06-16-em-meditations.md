title: "Stoicism for Engineering Managers"

Before I ever read *[The Daily Stoic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29093292-the-daily-stoic)*, I had already spent time with the original works—Seneca, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius. I loved them. But I always felt like something was missing: a version that brought it all together. A single place where the ideas were accessible, organized, and felt close to the world I live in.

When I discovered *The Daily Stoic* by Ryan Holiday, it clicked. One quote a day, one short reflection. Simple, structured. It became a daily ritual. And after a while, I started thinking: what if I did the same - but for engineering managers?

## Stoicism is not a buzzword

This isn’t about “staying calm” or pretending emotions don’t exist. Stoicism, as I understand it, is a practical philosophy. A way to live and lead with clarity.

- **Control what you can** - your actions, your integrity, your words  
- **Accept what you can’t** - org decisions, market shifts, other people  
- **Lead with virtue** - wisdom, courage, justice, discipline  
- **Be present** - not stuck in past mistakes or future anxieties

When you manage teams, this mindset becomes not just helpful, but necessary.

## The intersection of chaos and clarity

Engineering management sits at an uncomfortable intersection:

- **Systems** - codebases, delivery, infrastructure  
- **People** - motivation, burnout, growth  
- **Business** - shifting priorities, tradeoffs  
- **Self** - doubt, exhaustion, imposter syndrome

Stoicism doesn’t remove the chaos. But it helps create space between the chaos and your response to it.

## How I practice it

Over time, I’ve built a few rituals that stuck:

- **Morning intention**: Before a high-stakes conversation, I pause and ask: *What kind of leader do I want to be in this meeting?*  
- **Evening reflection**: A short check-in-what went well, what felt off, what I avoided  
- **Negative visualization**: What if this person resigns? What if the launch fails? Rehearsing it keeps me calm when it happens  
- **The view from above**: Zooming out-will this still matter in a month? What would my future self advise?


## Why I’m writing

*EM Meditations* is a GitHub repo where I’ll publish short reflections on engineering management, each grounded in a Stoic quote or idea.

It’s part journal, part practice. Not a guide, not advice-just honest thinking made public.

I hope it helps other engineering leaders feel a little more steady, a little more clear-headed, and a little less alone.

title: My all time favorite books
---

I was going over the books that I managed to read in 2021 and realized that this year was a bit special compared to my experience in the past years. This year, I was very quick to put away books that I picked up but did not enjoy reading, or did not find valuable for the given point of time. This gave me a chance to reflect a bit on my past readings and I thought to compile a short list of all time favorites.

Regardless of the genre, they provoked thoughts and gave perspective which I was lacking before, they challenged me, my beliefs and shaped me as a person.

Initially I was thinking to provide some details about why a certain book appears in the list below, however I realized I want to keep it short without any explanation, so please go ahead and explore the content.

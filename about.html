<p>Hey, I'm Vardan!</p>

<p>I'm a software engineer turned engineering manager. Currently I'm an Engineering Manager at <a href="https://grafana.com" target="_blank">Grafana Labs</a>.</p>

<p>I come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia" target="_blank">Armenia</a> but have been living in Berlin, Germany since 2013. 
    
<p>I've gotten my interest in computers quite early, since I watched my neighbour play games as a child:)  I've managed to save money and buy my first computer when I was 12 and started photoshoping myself with the big Holywood stars of the time.
I also played with making short movies with the software I had at hands.</p> 

<p>My journey with programming began when I overheard school teachers arguing about Turing Completness of Excel. My next move was to find out what they actually meant.</p>

<p>I spent the first couple of years at the university doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_%28programming_language%29" target="_blank">Pascal</a> and learning DOS. Eventually I realized that I need something more, so I ended up taking extra courses beside the university classes to learn Java. Until now, Java is my main programming language (despite the fact that I have not written Java in production in the last 3 years).</p>

<p>What follows is my professional career, and if you are curious to see what I have been doing in the past, feel free to checkout my <a href="/vardan_torosyan_cv.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
